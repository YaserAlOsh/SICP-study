# SICP-study
Here I share my solutions to SICP exercises.
I also follow 61A Berkeley course and some lab exercises are in the files.

## Why Studying SICP?
I started studying SICP book to build my understanding of Computer Science and Programming. 
It improved my programming skills and widened my perspective in more ways than I could have imagined.  
It was recommended to me on https://teachyourselfcs.com website, go check it out!

## Some stuff I built after learning Scheme and Racket:
### Radix Conversion Program:
Converts from any base to any base, showing the steps.  
#### Direct Conversion

#### Conversion with base-10

Uses Scheme with Racket for the GUI.  
Interestingly, you can mix both languages.  

### Capacitance Calculator
Simple calculator that calculates the capacitance of any complex circuit, containing parallel and/or series sub circuits.

Can also solve for the missing capacitance, given the total capacitance, in simple circuits only.

Only misses a UI!
