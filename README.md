# SICP-study
Here I share my solutions to SICP exercises.
I also follow 61A Berkeley course and some lab exercises are in the files.

## Why Studying SICP?
I started studying SICP book to build my understanding of Computer Science and Programming. 
It improved my programming skills and widened my perspective in more ways than I could have imagined.  
It was recommended to me on https://teachyourselfcs.com website, go check it out!

Converts from any base to any base with steps.  
Can convert directly, or by going to base-10 first:

Uses Scheme with Racket for the GUI.  
Interestingly, you can mix both languages.
